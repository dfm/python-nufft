Python bindings to a subset of the `NUFFT algorithm
<http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html>`_. Only the 1D and 2D cases are
implemented.

Usage
-----

To install, run ``python setup.py install``. Then, to evaluate a type-3 FT,
use ``nufft.nufft3``. Assuming that you have a time series in ``t`` and ``y``
and you want to evaluate it at (angular) frequencies ``f``:

.. code-block:: python

    import nufft
    ft = nufft.nufft3(t, y, f)

You can specify your required precision using ``eps=1e-15``. The default is
``1e-15``.
